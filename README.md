# Fonts package for Atom

Oh we do love our monospace fonts don't we? To celebrate typography and free choice, I've packaged all the great fonts I could get my hands on (43 of them at this point).

This package delivers them straight to Atom through the power of @font-face. You no longer need to hunt down and install your favourite font, instead you can now instantly try out any of the fonts in this package.
